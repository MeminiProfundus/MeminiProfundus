/*
Though my major's not computer engineering, I'm learning to code.
I enjoy studying things in a number of domains...
Latin , Biochemistry, Chemistry, Chemical engineering(Chemistry and chemical engineering is different), Math... and coding.
Some may see these as a pile of unrelated discipline.
And, that... actually, may be true. Maybe.
But I'm certain all of these knowledges will pay off.
